# Clasp Pusher

Simple too for pushing new production releases to the Google Docs "production document".

## Setup

Git clone this repo locally.

## Steps:

1. Fill out the `.clasp.json` file with the correct "production document" script id.
2. From terminal (in project root), run:

    ```bash
    yarn clasp:push
    ```

That's it!
